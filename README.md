ðŸŒŠ **Marine Economics Data Analysis Using SQL**

This project involved leveraging SQL queries to analyze a dataset encompassing marine economic data. The dataset included attributes such as year, category, data value, magnitude, source, and flag.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of the project was to gain insights into marine economic activities, including fisheries, shipping, and tourism, through SQL-based analysis.

**Approach:**
Using SQL queries, we explored various aspects of the dataset, including trend analysis over time, category-wise performance, and the influence of different factors such as source and magnitude. We employed SQL functionalities like joins, aggregation, filtering, and sorting to extract meaningful insights.

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Exploration:** We began by understanding the dataset structure and identifying relevant attributes.
2. **Query Execution:** SQL queries were crafted to perform tasks such as calculating total values, finding maximum values, computing averages, and identifying trends.
3. **Filtering and Aggregation:** Data filtering was applied to focus on specific criteria, and aggregation functions were employed to summarize data.
4. **Insights Generation:** Through SQL-based analysis, we derived insights into the performance of different economic categories, trends over time, and the impact of various factors on economic activities.

**Conclusion:**
By harnessing the power of SQL, this project provided valuable insights into marine economic trends, contributing to informed decision-making processes within the marine sector.
